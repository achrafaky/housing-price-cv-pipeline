## 📌 Project Overview
In machine learning, relying on a single train-test split can lead to overly optimistic (or pessimistic) performance estimates. This project demonstrates a robust methodology for predicting housing prices using the Ames Housing Dataset. 

Instead of a basic split, this project implements **K-Fold Cross-Validation** combined with **Scikit-Learn Pipelines** to ensure accurate model evaluation and strictly prevent data leakage during preprocessing.

## 🎯 Key Skills & Concepts Demonstrated
* **Robust Model Evaluation:** Implementing 5-Fold Cross-Validation to calculate a reliable Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and assess model stability.
* **Data Leakage Prevention:** Utilizing `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` to bundle imputation and modeling. This ensures that statistics (like the mean for missing values) are calculated *only* on the training folds, never on the validation folds.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing numerical data programmatically using `SimpleImputer`.
* **Ensemble Learning:** Training a Baseline `RandomForestRegressor` for predictive modeling.
